        <h1>Reflection on<br/>Unpacking a Tech System</h1>
        <p class="kicker">
          The purpose of this page is to summarize my experience and learning I captured during the Unpacking Tech Systems course during the MDEF program. This post encapsulates my thoughts over the context, process and outcomes of the unpacking of a 3D printer.
        </p>
      </header>

      <!-- CONTEXT -->
      <section class="section">
        <h3>Context</h3>
        <p>In our 1st Term, we participated in a course called “Unpacking Tech Systems,” which was a two-week intensive course to understand the anatomy, functionality of complex machines in groups. Then in week two, we had to compile a new structure with functionalities using the parts of the original machine. This document captures the learnings of the first week.
On the first day of the course, we had to find and select multiple machines from the backyard of IAAC, and through team-decision-making, we had to pick for out team activities. Our selection landed on a 3D printer machine that seemed to be in quite good condition. The same day we had to formulate our teams based on our key skill / background. For the purposes of this course I selected not a top skill of mine, but to be the “coder” of our team, as our MDEF group lacks of coding / tech architect background.
An important contextual information my true background, as over the years I participated in tech projects when we had to understand systems, software to compile assessments, and potential improvement options. Therefore, leading and conducting a forensics process was something I already did in my life, but I have never worked with hardware components before, and I had minimal clue on electric circuits and sensors. This last statement has changed over the two-week program.
</p>
      </section>

      <!-- PROCESS -->
      <section class="section">
        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>The requirement we received was to completely unpack the printer, understand how it works, assess the condition of each component, try to solve what caused the decommissioning of the machine. The expected outcome was two documents. On a comprehensive forensic report on the complete machine, the second one was a brief report on one dedicated components.

I usually arrive prepared to a new project; this situation was not any different, and before the second day, I did my due diligenceon  how 3D printers work. In my “coder” role, I focused on the components, the working fundamentals, information, and signal flows. As we could identify the model I had an easy job to get prepared. I like talking with an AI agent riding my bike when I have free time to validate my assumptions, seek further information. By the time I arrived to IAAC, I knew what is a firmware, how the information flows between parts and externals sources. I also learnt that for 3D printing the 3D graphical object is sliced into 2D images. That helped me to actively participate in discussion with the FabLab experts. I can say, this course complemented my other classes related to 3D printing and modelling.

Our team was really structured and worked in a good rythim, however, before we could try if the machine still works, my teammates started the unpacking process. In the meantime, I was looking for a power source cable downstairs. I used this time to ask around in the FabLab that can help us understanding the history of the machine. I also found out that the gadget box where we found the machine was full with rainwater over the week, so the current condition of the machine might not be the one that resulted the end of the lifecycle of the printer.

During the unpacking process, we categorised the parts over our desk - a super idea from Ale - resulting in a clear catalog. As we proceeded, my thinking was still focusing on the connection points of the components, so I started to draft an architecture and flow chart - we use this at work regularly to understand a system.

      <!-- PROCESS CONTINUED -->
      <section class="section">
        <p>In this process tough we carried out more experiments, test runs per each components compared to my work. Before, I never had to understand the voltage need of a machine, just maybe the signals / codes components pass around. It was definitely a learning experience for me. 

For the report writing I tried to be one step ahead of my team - as I had experience with these reports - and layout a document structure we can discuss. They provided great points to add and visualisation ideas. It surprised me how easily we could work together on these documents as usually this is not something appealing for others. 

For the end of the week we had to turn our report into a webpage using MarkDown technique which was new for me. I have experience with coding, but this approach was quite new, but super easy to learn. 

On the last day we had to carry out a brief presentation and Q&A on our report. Presenting is something I have experience with, but it was interesting to observe that my lack of jargon/professional expressions made communication harder/discomforting. 

Overall I loved this week, the topic was interesting, the IAAC and FabLab team was amazing - I learned from them as a trainer - and the team work was amazing.

        <h3>Learnings</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>My “be prepared” attitude is tested and proven, it worth the effort and time. </li>
          <li>Adding the hardware perspective of a known task / process can generate totally new situations. </li>
          <li>Having an initial structure - for a document, for a process - is essential and helps the team. </li>
          <li>I could have managed and structured the time and task management of the team better, but I did not want to over-dominate the work. </li>
          <li>Know what you talk about. This is something that I tell my team at work. It was interesting to be in a situation where my knowledge / vocabulary was short. </li>
